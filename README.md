# Metadata

A Python library that provides a thin wrapper to the [OpenElections Metadata API](http://docs.openelections.net/metadata-api/), which contains information about elections and the nature and availability of results data. The [API provides JSON endpoints for individual states](http://blog.openelections.net/an-improved-metadata-api/) and Metadata provides a way to search for and filter elections within a state.

Metadata has been tested under Python 2.7
